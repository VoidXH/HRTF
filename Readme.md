## How it's made
These impulse responses are home-made with a cheap setup. They offer mediocre
spatial cues, but little artifacts with a flatter frequency response than most
free HRTF databases. The results are based on a single subject, with the
following setup in a small room (hence the 64 sample length for the aligned
impulses):
* A pillar of Klipsch R-15M speakers
* Genius SW-G 2.1 3000 amplifier
* JBL E15 microphone in the pinna directed to the ear canal
* Cavern 1.2 QuickEQ set to 65536 samples
The usable frequency range of this setup is 120-12500 Hz.
